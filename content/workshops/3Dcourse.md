+++

During this short 5 week course you will be introduced to 3D modelling for 3D printing, and how CAD (SolidWorks) is used in this.

 - Date: Tuesday 7 March 2017, 6.30pm – 9.30pm
 - Course length: 5 weeks
 - Price: £150 (£135.00 for students)
 - Tutor: Rhys John
 - Level: Beginner
 - Campus: Llandaff Campus, B Block

The first weeks will introduce the process, basic SolidWorks functions, tools used and an initial brief. This is followed by a quick prototyping workshop and will continue in using digital design tools such as SolidWorks to focus towards digital manufacturing.
The aim of the course will to be equip participants with a basic understanding and set of capabilities in SolidWorks along with a small CAD generated prototype product created using exciting FabLab equipment such as laser cutters.
This course is ideal if you’re getting into digital manufacturing (3D printing, laser cutting or CNC milling) and need a starting point from a digital point of view.

Participants will be able to use their own (Windows) laptop to use SolidWorks and start designing real products set by a brief from the course tutor. There are a limited number of pc’s available during the course. Let us know if you would require one.
