This workshop will teach you the basics of an advanced 3D software package (SolidWorks). This workshop will teach participants two important modeling skills (free-form modeling and parametric modeling). The skills learned this workshop can be easily applied to create advanced 3D printable objects, such as objects with unique shapes.

 - Date: Tuesday 16th May 2017, 6.30pm – 9.30pm
 - Course length: 1 week
 - Price: £35 (£31.50 for students)
 - Tutor: Rhys John
 - Level: Beginner
 - Campus: Llandaff Campus, B Block

The workshop will introduce you to SolidWorks, a very advanced 3D design software package. The aim of the course will to be equip participants with a basic understanding and set of capabilities in SolidWorks along with a small 3D printed object.

Participants will be able to use their own (Windows) laptop to use SolidWorks and start designing products for a limited time after the course. There are a limited number of pc’s available during the course. Let us know if you would require one.
