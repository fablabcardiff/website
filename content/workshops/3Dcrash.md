3D printing is currently at the forefront of advanced prototyping and amateur model making. It allows the user to print plastic parts, models and figures with relative ease.

During this short 3 hr workshop participants will learn the basics of 3D printing. Participants will skip the 3D modeling stage and will be invited to choose a 3D model from a pre approved library. They will then be guided through the 3D print process from point of approval of 3D design, through the process of using 3D print software, loading the 3D printer with material and finally printing a 3D model.

This workshop is a taster, with enough interest we will run a comprehensive six week workshop. If you are interested in learning to use 3D design software and designing your own parts to 3D print please check out our up coming courses or contact us for more information.)
